The website we have created hosts sports betting for both NFL and NBA games. If a user chooses to bet on the NFL they will have to choose a running back, wide receiver and a quarterback. The user is betting on which player will have the most yards in their respective fields. The way the payout works is as follows: if a user hits 1 out their 3 choices they will receive 33% of their bet back, 66% for 2 and a 100% return for hitting all three.

As for NBA, our website tracks the games that are going on and uses an API to get the games played every night. Our users are able to pick 3 teams they believe will win and will receive the same odds as the NFL bets if their choices won.
